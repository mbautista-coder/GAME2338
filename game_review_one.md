### Rating: I give this game a 4 out of 5 star rating.

## Summary
This game is a sequel to the previous game South park: the stick of truth and its also in the setting of the animated series South park 
created by Matt Stone and Trey Parker. However in this game setting the player is role-playing with the south park kids as superheros, 
where they go around town fighting crime and solving various quests. 
the player at the beginning of the game creates their south park persona then choosing their difficulty, this is a turned-based game where you will either 
attack or be attacked. 
In this game the player has the decision to choose their superhero class for example a cyborg, 
speedster, psyhic etc.
                      The player will also need to make the decision on who they want to have in their party, in order to do this they
must recuit party members (south park gang) around town by helping them on quests once helped they will befriend the player.
whats very important in this game is that the player must improve their might level by obtaining various artifacts by
completeing story quests, side quests and puzzles. The higher might level the player has the more stronger their south park persona will be.
Another important objective in this game is being popular in order to do this the player must go around town and find people to follow them on
coonstagram and take selfies, the more followers the player obtains the more popular the player is, this helps with following the main story.
The player will get hurt in battle and in order to prevent death the player must either, block, craft bandages/food or have a healer on their team.
Its very crucial to have a healer on the team this game is also heavily based on strategy so always look at the strats.


## Final Thoughts:
The things that I liked about this game is that it was very humorous I love the new playable characters they added and 
the in-game interactions with other characters. The game mechanics were a big improvement from the last game South park: the stick of truth. 
the developers added tiles on the floor so the player is able to choose where to attack and block. The two things 
I didnt like about this game is that the map is smaller from the last game and a has shorter story.
