### Rating
I give this game a 4 out of 5 star rating

## Summary
South Park: Phone Destroyer is a mobile card game where the player is considered "the new kid" and is recruited by Eric Cartman to defeat
Kyle and his group, in order to do this the new kid must collect and upgrade cards. Each card is one of the characters from the show 
South Park. The player summons a character by placing a card on the battlefield and each card has its own theme and unique attacks. 
For example each theme consists of either Adventure, Sci-fi, Fanasty, etc. The Player may only carry two theme in their deck.

As the player progresses in the game, there will be checkpoints where the player must have a certain amount of phones destroyed. In order 
to do this the player must battle in online PvP matches, where they will battle random players and try to destroy as much phones as possible
in order to progess farther in the story. Battling in PvP matches benefits the player by helping the player rank up and giving the player
a chance to win items to upgrade their deck. The better the card, the stronger the attacks.

After a battle has been won, the player will have a set of lockers to choose from and will only be able to open 3. Each other will either 
contain items for card upgrades, tickets to purchase items or convert into coins, and new cards to add to the deck. Coins in the game are
used to upgrade cards while tickets can be used in the shops. Each theme of cards has a rarity. 

## Final Thoughts
I like this game because its addicting, challenging and very humorous. I like that the player is able to make a guild and invite friends 
to battle againest eachother. The one thing I didnt like about this game would be that it can be very laggy at times.
