Step 2: Developers make sure they have a functioning build.
            
Step 3: Game testers must shoot everything, run through everything and, jump 15,000 times in the same place. 

Step 4: Manual testing meaning they have someone moniter the game testers to see if it works the developers want the game to work.

Step 5: Making sure the weapons work correctly in the game cause if one of the weapons dont work it can effect the other weapons.

Step 5: Testing the vehicles by jumping over the gaps and driving them. Because if this isnt tested the player may die ever time.

Step 6: Play testing, this when the developers get a bunch of people and have them play the game and test if they are able to 
play the game and solving certain objectives.

Step 7: Figuring out what stuff to keep in the games, this method is called triage or how the developers describe is "blood sucking".
