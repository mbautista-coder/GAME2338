### Rating
I rate this game 4 out of 5 stars.

## Summary
Raft is a survival game, where the player spawns on a raft in the middle of nowhere in the ocean. In order to survive the player is
equipped with a grappling hook, where they will need to grapple scraps of plastic, wood and metal from the ocean. there are also barrels 
that float around which contain more material and sometimes seeds. As the player collects materials from the ocean they will be able to 
start crafting more floors for the raft, a grill to cook fish, and a water filter. 

The objective is not only to survive, the player will need to defend their raft from a shark that roams around. The shark attacks the raft,
destroying the floor. The player is able to stop the shark by crafting a spear and jabbing the shark. The player is able to kill the shark,
by doing this multiple times and once the shark is dead the player may go into the water and receive shark meat to eat. However a new shark
spawns later on.

Once the player has lots of materials and builds more flooring, they will be able to unlock more recipes to craft more tools. Two of the
useful tools is crafting an anchor and a sail, this allows the player to stop and navigate their raft in order to explore islands. Islands
are very useful for gathering more food and taming animals to bring along for the journey. The player is able to tame Llamas for their fur
and tame goats for their milk.

## Final Thoughts
I like this game because of the challenges it comes with and how enjoyable it can be, it keeps the player alert and busy. The game has good
mechanics and peaceful gameplay. the things I didnt like about this game would be that it can be glitchy, there would be times where it 
would kick me out of the game and when I would jab the shark the spear would just go straight through the head given it no damage.
