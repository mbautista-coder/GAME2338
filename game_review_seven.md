### Rating
I rate this game 4 out of 5. 

## Summary
Garry's mod is a physics sandbox game, where players are able to make games with either the NPCs that are built in the game 
or download addons in the steam workshop that are made by other players. This game is built on a modified verison of Valves 
source engine, players are able to do so many things such as make a short animation, make a simple game and just build a funny
picture. there is even an option to do online co-op where a player is able to build a map or play on a pre-made map and do
either puzzles, RP's(role-play) or even build something together.

Garry's mod has some very popluar games such as prop hunt, where players are able to be an inanimate object and hide somewhere
where that prop would be. Props have a time limit to hide and hunters are blindfolded, once unblindfolded they will try to find
the hidden props by shooting items that seem suspicious around the map. There have been players that have made maps for this gamemode
and have even added their own changes such different playermodels, different props and different gameplay.

The Garry's mod community always comes up with different new addons and gamemodes that its endless, players are also able to make
servers either private or public. Garry's mod always has updates as well with adding some new tools such as changing an NPcs facial
expression, to new texture packs as well. Players are even able to make their own sandbox map if they don't like the one that is 
offered or they cna download a different sandbox map pre-made.

## Final Thoughts
I like Garry's mod i think its a good sandbox game, there are so many things to do. I have played many of the customs games and
played on many servers. I have also made my fair share of funny pictures and have bulit some maps with my friends. there are some
dowbnfalls to the game in which if there are too many addons downloaded the game wont work properly, and will most likey lag. There
are also many bugs the game. the game may have invisbile walls, clip-in texture and missing textures if the player doesnt
download a specific addon.
