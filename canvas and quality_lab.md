Similar games: Minecraft. Halo 2, and Mario Party 4.

Quality Factors: Reusability, Reliablity, Flexability, Integrity.

My Reasoning: 
Minecraft: There is always something new to do in Minecraft, there are many updates that makes the player comeback for more, and
there is hardly any crashes in Minecraft.

Halo 2: Halo in general always has an amazing storyline and good gameplay which makes the player want to play the game again, and hardly any
crashes. 

Mario Party 4: Mario party has never had any crashes, the player/players are able to play as much as they want, and the game has great
gameplay with it being a big digital board game and minigames.
