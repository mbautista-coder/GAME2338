### Rating
I rate this game 4 out of 5 stars.

## Summary

SpeedRunners is a multiplayer racing game where the player can choose between the five main characters, however there is more 
characters to choose from however the player just needs to purchase/download them. the objective of the game is that the player must 
be able to reach the finish line without getting sabotaged by the other players. In SpeedRunners the player is able to get 
items throughout the course to sabotage the others players so they wont reach the finish line. 

Either the game can sabotage the player or the other players can. The map may contain spikes, boxes and many more diversions.
The items that the player can receive can be a golden hook, homing rockets, bombs and many more items/pickups. There have been 
times where the game has been ongoing and there are only two people left in the game, the game is timed so the map starts to get
smaller and then a dead zone starts appearing so there can be winner.

SpeedRunners has multiple maps to choose from and there are also custom maps, the maps can either be in a city, powerplant, mansion,
and many more maps to choose from. The player doesnt need to play with multiple people there is an option to race against the AIs. 
The player has the option to choose the difficulty of the AIs and challenge themselves or get a better feel for the game, its just as
fun as playing with other people. 

## Final Thoughts
I like SpeedRunners for the multiple maps it has to offer and multiple characters. The one thing I dont like about this game is that doesnt
work with a controller even though its supported. I dont like having to use a keyboard for this type of game cause it has many controls.
