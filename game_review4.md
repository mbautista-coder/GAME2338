### Rating
I rate this game 4 out of 5 stars.

## Summary
Super Mario party is a refresh of the orignal Mario party series, its a 4 player board game where the players have to roll the dice
to see where they move. The objective of the game is to earn the most stars than the rest of the players, the player with the most 
stars wins. In order to earn stars the player must move to the locations where the stars are on the board. there is only one star 
on the board until someone earns it, then another star appears in a different location.

The other players have the ability to steal stars from other players, this happens when they land on a certain tile on the
board. However they need coins to be able to do this, in order to earn coins the player must win multiple mini games on the board. 
Players can either purchase a star or steal a star, when landing on a certain tile. Coins are also used to purchase items, these 
items benefit the player into getting close to the stars on the board or sabotage players and steal their coins.

When rolling the dice the player must try to avoid danger areas on the board which can make them lose coins. Earning coins in the game
is a huge benefit to the player if they want to purchase items or a star when offered. The mini games are skill-based and there are over
80 mini games. Once completed a game the players are able to play the mini games without playing the board game, they will be able to
do a free for all mini matches. 

## Final Thoughts
I like this game because its addiciting, challenging, and there so many mini games/game modes to choose from. What I dont like about this
game is the maps are smaller than how the game cube version was and it feels rushed.
